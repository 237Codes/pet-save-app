## Brief Description
A Pet Save Platform which is a community-driven app where users can report lost and found pets, helping reunite them with their owners. Users can upload photos, and specify details such as breed and last seen location, and the platform uses AI to classify pets by species and estimate their weight and breed. The app also provides a matching system that suggests potential connections between lost and found pets based on image analysis. Users earn rewards for reporting pets and successfully helping to reunite them with their owners, incentivizing engagement. The platform aims to streamline the process of finding lost pets and offering assistance.

 

## Core Features:

### Report Lost Pets:
1. Users can submit reports of their lost pets, including photos, the petâ€™s species, breed, last known location, and estimated weight.
2. The system stores these reports and makes them available for viewing by others.
### Report Found Pets:
1. Users who find a pet can upload details and photos of the animal, including where they found the pet.
2. The platform uses AI to classify the pet by species and estimate the breed and weight.
### AI-Driven Pet Classification:
1. We'll integrate an AI service that can classify pets based on images uploaded by users, estimating their species, breed, and approximate weight.
2. This will improve the accuracy of matching found pets with lost pet reports.
### Reward System:
1. Users earn points for every pet they report as lost or found, and additional rewards if they help reunite a lost pet with its owner.
### Community Engagement:
1. A public feed of lost and found pets to promote visibility.
Users can search for pets based on location, breed, or other attributes.
### Dashboard to visualize pets found and total reports over time.

## User Flow:

### Lost Pet Submission:
1. User uploads a photo, selects species, breed, and enters details (location, weight, etc.).
2. AI analyzes the image to classify the pet and provide further data for the report.
### Found Pet Submission:
1. User uploads a photo of the found pet and adds details.
2. The AI attempts to match this found pet with any existing lost pet reports based on the uploaded image, breed, and weight.
### Reward System:
1. Users earn points for reporting pets and additional rewards for helping reunite lost pets with owners.
2. A leaderboard or achievement system can further incentivize users.
### Account Authentication:
1. A user can log in, sign up, or continue as a guest.
2. Once authenticated, users can manage their account settings, including updating their email and changing their password.
